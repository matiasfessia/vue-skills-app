    <h1>About this app</h1>
    <p>This app was developed during the <a href="https://www.udemy.com/course/vue-2-crash-course">Vue Crash Course of Udemy</a> that I took. Notice that the vee-validator has changed introducing breaking-changes from version 2 to 3. So I implemented using this last version in order to keep the app up-to-date.</p>
